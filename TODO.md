Everything here exists
- Fedora Docker (update apt)
- Maybe setting up packages on the host (too late for that, maybe if someone wants to start from scratch and show, or do that on some Ubuntu docker or whatever... Maybe I'll do that too. But this is relatively easy to figure out, there is nothing too special about it.
- GPG key creation for GRUB
- Certificate creation for UEFI

TODO:
- GPT partition
- Maybe list of packages inside the rootfs?! [although I think it was already more bloated then needed]
